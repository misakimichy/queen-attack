# Queen Attack

#### _C#, .NET: Queen Attack, 9/23/2019_

## Description
It's a console application where the user can enter X and Y coordinates for both a queen and another chess piece. The program should return whether the queen is capable of 'attacking' the other chess piece.

## Application should have:
In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, making it the most powerful piece on the board. If another piece is within its line of sight along these three lines, the queen may attack it.

- When the user submits coordinates, the program should create an instance of a Queen class, with properties for its X and Y coordinates.

- The Queen class should have a method that takes X and a Y coordinate as arguments, and returns true if the queen can attack the given space, and false if it cannot.

- A message should be displayed to inform the user of the results.
